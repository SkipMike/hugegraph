Storage Backends
================

hugegraph's data storage layer is pluggable.  Implementations of the
pluggable storage layer -- that is, the software component tells hugegraph
how to talk to its data store -- are called storage backends.

This section describes configuration and administration of hugegraph's
standard storage backends.

This section only addresses configuration of the stock storage
backends that come with hugegraph.
