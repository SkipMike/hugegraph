Upgrade Instructions
--------------------

Please follow these instructions when upgrading from Titan or an older
hugegraph release.

Upgrading from Titan
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

hugegraph is based on the latest commit to the `titan11` branch of
https://github.com/thinkaurelius/titan[Titan repo].

hugegraph has made the following changes to Titan, so you will need to adjust
your code and configuration accordingly:

. module names: `titan-*` are now `hugegraph-*`
. package names: `com.thinkaurelius.titan` are now `com.baidu.hugegraph`
. class names: `Titan*` are now `hugegraph*` except in cases where this would
  duplicate a word, e.g., `TitanGraph` is simply `hugegraph` rather than
  `hugegraphGraph`

The BerkeleyDB version has been updated, and it contains changes to the file
format stored on disk. This file format change is forward compatible with
previous versions of BerkeleyDB, so existing graph data stored with Titan
can be read in. However, once the data has been read in with the newer version
of BerkeleyDB, those files can no longer be read by the older version. Users
are encouraged to backup the BerkeleyDB storage directory before attempting to
use it with the hugegraph release.
