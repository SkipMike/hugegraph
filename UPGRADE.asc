Upgrade Instructions
--------------------

Please follow these instructions when upgrading from Titan or an older
hugegraph release.

Upgrading from Titan
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

hugegraph is based on the latest commit to the `titan11` branch of
https://github.com/thinkaurelius/titan[Titan repo].

hugegraph has made the following changes to Titan, so you will need to adjust
your code and configuration accordingly:

. module names: `titan-*` are now `hugegraph-*`
. package names: `com.thinkaurelius.titan` are now `com.baidu.hugegraph`
. class names: `Titan*` are now `hugegraph*` except in cases where this would
  duplicate a word, e.g., `TitanGraph` is simply `hugegraph` rather than
  `hugegraphGraph`
